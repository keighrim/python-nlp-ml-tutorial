# A Brief Tutorial on Machine Learning with NLTK/Python

This is a tutorial on machine learning techniques using NLTK in Python. It is based on Python 3.6 and NLTK.

You can see the example code in [NLTK.ipynb](NLTK.ipynb)

To run the code locally, you need to have [ipython](https://ipython.org/) and [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook. 
You'll also need the following python packages. 
* nltk
* scikit-learn
